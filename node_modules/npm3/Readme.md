# npm3

Wraps the 'next' version of [npm v3](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/122450408965/npm-weekly-20-npm-3-is-here-ish) as an executable `npm3`.

Allows you to use npm v3 alongside whatever other version of `npm` you currently have installed.

## Installation & Update


```
npm install -g npm3
```

Remember to run this semi-regularly to get the latest version of npm v3.

Make sure you understand what's changing in npm v3 by reading the excellent [Release Notes](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases).

## Usage

The `npm3` executable behaves exactly like `npm`:

```
> npm3 -v
3.2.2
> npm3 install
> npm3 search
# etc
```
